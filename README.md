# Next.js: SSG + Preview Mode Demo

This demo showcases Next.js' next-gen Static Site Generation (SSG) support.

## About

Next.js is the first hybrid framework, allowing you to choose the technique
that fits your use case best on a per-page basis:
[Static Generation or On-Demand rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching).

This application solely focuses on Static Generation (using `getStaticProps`),
however, with a game-changing new feature: Preview Mode.

[Take Preview Mode for a spin](https://next-preview.vercel.app/)!

Preview Mode leverages Next.js' on-demand rendering capabilities to bypass the
statically prerendered page and render the page on-demand for
**authorized users**.

This feature is incredibly valuable for content editors who want to view
real-time draft content from their CMS, among other use cases.
